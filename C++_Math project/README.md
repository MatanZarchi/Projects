# In this exercise we will deal with fractions of polynomials with a single variable x
# A polynomial is a sum of monomials with a single variable x
# Each polynomial will be represented by an object in the Polynomial class. Each object of the polynomial type has its maximum degree defined.
# A fraction is represented by two polynomials - the denominator and the numerator.
